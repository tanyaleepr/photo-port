# Lizza's Oh Snap!

## Description
In this React project, I helped Lyza, a family friend and aspiring photographer, who wanted a simple website to exhibit her images. I utilized my newly acquired React abilities to develop Oh Snap!, a single-page application that employs React state, properties, Hooks, and reusable UI components to give a simple yet elegant platform for displaying your photographic skills.
